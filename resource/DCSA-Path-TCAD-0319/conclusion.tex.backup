\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we have proposed the first method to generate a biochip
architecture considering storage requirements. By caching
fluid samples on-the-spot, transportation channels and storage channels were
unified into a connection graph. In addition, transportation paths were
constructed on a connection grid dynamically 
and transportation conflicts were modeled
directly instead of being dealt with in a post-processing step. We also proposed the first method 
to construct flow paths on biochip architectures.  We also proposed a method to agument a biochip architecture with the Genetic Algorithm,
when flow paths cannot be constructed with the resources on the original chip. 
Experimental results confirmed 
that with this uniform model the architecture generated by the proposed method  
is more efficient in executing biochemical assays even with fewer resources.
