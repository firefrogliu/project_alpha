Flow-based microfluidic biochips have attracted much attention in the EDA
community due to their miniaturized size and execution efficiency. 
Previous research, however, still follows the traditional 
computing model with a dedicated storage unit, which actually becomes
a bottleneck of the performance of bio-chips.
Additional, flow paths that enalbe actual transportations on biochips have not
been considered.
%and design automation flow,
%which, unfortunately, may not produce an efficeint chip architecture.
%In additional,
%the architectures of such chips traditionally follow the architecutre of
%micro-controllers 
In this paper, we propose the first architectural synthesis framework considering 
distributed storage constructed temporarily from transportation channels to 
cache fluid samples.
Since distributed storage can be accessed more efficiently 
than a dedicated storage unit and channels can switch between the roles of
transportation and storage easily, biochips with this distributed computing
architecture can achieve a higher execution efficiency even with fewer resources. 
We also propos the first method to construct flow paths to enable real 
world transportations.
Experimental results confirm that the execution efficiency of a bioassay

reduced effectively. %by up to 83\%.
