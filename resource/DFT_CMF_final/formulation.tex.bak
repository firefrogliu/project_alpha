\section{Motivation and Problem Formulation}\label{sec:motivation}

In flow-based microfluidic biochips, flow channels and control channels are
etched upon a substrate from PDMS through a process including molding and
assembling \cite{C2LC40258K}. 
%Air pressure is conducted through control channesl to the membrane layer at
%the intersections between flow and control channels to activate valves. 
In this multiple-step process, defects may appear in the manufactured chips.
For example, flow channels may be broken during the molding process; and flow
and control layers may not be aligned properly so that the pressure conducted
through control channels cannot reach reach the corresponding valves, leading
to valves that cannot be closed.  Figure~\ref{fig:defects} shows cases with
broken flow and control channels \cite{HuYHC14}, two typical defects after
manufacturing, leading to defects such as flow channels that are blocked and
valves that cannot be closed.

To identify biochips with defects after manufacturing, a given set of test
vectors needs to be applied, each of which is a combination of valve states.
In the test procedure, air pressue sources are connected to some ports of the
chip.  A test vector is then applied to open and close the valves to create
flow paths inside the chip to test the defects where channels are blocked or
valves cannot be opened.  Pressure meters are attached to other ports of the
chip and the measured pressure results are compared with a predetermined set
of measurements. If discrepancy exists, the chip is then reported as with
defects. Reciprocally, to test the defects that valves cannot be closed, some
valves are closed to separate the pressure sources and meters. If pressure can
still be measured, a defect is thus detected.  In this test procedure, usually
air pressure instead of fluid is used to keep the chip from being contaminated
before they are sold on the market.

%In the test procedure, the measured pressure at test ports are evaluated as
%binary results. The intermediate levels of pressure values are not considered
%to reduce the complexity and uncertainty. Consequently, the test procedure of
%such biochips is very similar to the test procedure of integrated circuits.
%Accordingly, these test methods proposed in 
%\cite{HuYHC14,HuHC14} convert this test problem into a digital circuit and
%applied ATPG methods to generate test vectors directly. 
%On the contrary, the
%method in \cite{Liudate17} examines the relation between the test vectors and
%the pressure measurements directy and construct test vectors accordingly.
%These methods, however, do not consider cost reduction in the overall test
%platform.

%The test procedure usually consists three steps: (1) External ports on the chip are
%connected to pressure sources and meters; (2) Test vectors are applied and
%the open/closed states of valves are inside the chip are changed accordingly;
%(3) Air pressrue is pushed into the chip. If there are flow paths from a
%pressure source to a pressure mether on which all valves are open, the meter
%is supposed to detect the pressure; otherwise, if there is no open path from a
%pressure source to the meter, it thus returns no pressure reading. This result
%is compared with a predetermined value for this test vector, and a mismatch in
%any of the meter outputs indicates a defect in chip.

The test procedure can be explained using
\figname~\ref{fig:multiPortSingPort}(a), where the biochip has three ports and
six valves.  
%where test vectors are applied to test
%a biochip with three ports. 
Since a valve allows pressure propagation in either
direction, the ports of a biochip are equivalent in the test procedure, so that
each of them can be connected to either a pressure source or a pressure meter.
The biochip in \figname~\ref{fig:multiPortSingPort}(a) contains in total three
ports, one of which is connected to a pressure source and the other two are
connected to pressure meters. The rectangular blocks in this chip represent
valves. 
%and the valves with filled color are closed. 
In this example, two test
vectors, path P1 and path P2, are used to detect the defects in which valves
cannot be opened. When a test vector is applied, all the other valves that are
not on the path are closed. If a valve on the path cannot be opened due to
manufacturing defects, the pressure meters cannot measure any pressure,
because no other path from the pressure source to the meter exists. Similar to
test paths, test vectors also contain cuts to verify whether valves can be
opened correctly. For example, if one of the four cuts C1--C4 in
\figname~\ref{fig:multiPortSingPort}(a) is applied, the chip is separated into
two parts and the pressure from the source should not reach any pressure meter.
If a pressure meter still reads valid pressure values, a defect is then
detected. For convenience, we call a valve that cannot be opened a stuck-at-0
defect and a valve that cannot be closed a stuck-at-1 defect. Except these
defects, there are also leakage defects between flow channels and control
channels, which also affects the function of a chip and can be tested
similarly \cite{HuYHC14}. In this paper, we will use only stuck-at-0 and
stuck-at-1 defects to demonstrate the proposed the design-for-testibility
method.

\end{figure}

In \figname~\ref{fig:multiPortSingPort}(a), one pressure source and two
pressure meters are required. These mechanical devices are curmbersome and the
installation as well as their connection to the biochip under test makes the
test procedure error-prone. Therefore, it is beneficial to reduce the number of
such devices to the minimum in the test platform.  To achieve this reduction,
the architectue of the biochip in \figname~\ref{fig:multiPortSingPort}(a) can
be modified to add more channels and valves, so that only one pressure source and
one meter are required, as shown in \figname~\ref{fig:multiPortSingPort}(b).
With this reductioin, test paths P1-P2 and cuts C1-C6 can still be generated
successfully to detect manufacturing defects. Obviously this modification
introduces more channels and valves into the chip. However, the cost of the
chip does not increase noticeably, because biochips are manufactured 
using masks as for IC manufacturing, where the most cost comes from the
generation of the mask itself. 
%no matter how many devices and channels are on
%the mask, provided that the area occupied by the chips does not change.
The slightly increased number of test vectors is also affordable since
state-of-the-art biochp design still allows for more than 10 minutes for each
chip to be tested.

The introduced valves in the modified chip architecture still need to be
controlled by control ports connected to them, as illustrated in
\figname~\ref{fig:valve_mixer_chip}. In the case where additional independent
control ports can be provided,
%in application environment, 
the two valves and channels in \figname~\ref{fig:multiPortSingPort}(b)
provides new resources for the execution of applications. Therefore, the
performance of the biochip can be improved accordingly. If, on the other hand,
the control logic is not capable of providing additional independent control
ports, the new valves introduced to increase testibilty should share a control
port together with another existing valve in the original biochip. This
sharing still needs to allow a valid set of test vectors to be generated to
test all the stuck-at-0 and stuck-at-1 defects.
%and the execution efficientcy of application should still be maintained.

%In addition, 
When an application is executed by the modified biochip, 
%the modified chip architecture and the shared valves
it should provide similar performance compared with the version before
modification.  The sharing of control logic between a newly added valve and an
existing valve, however, limits the flexibility in transporting fluid results
between devices, because contamination may occur due to the valves that
are forced to open together with another valve. Similarly, the forced close state of
shared valve increases the chance of blocking in fluid transportation, thus
also leading to a low execution efficiency of the application.

With the discussion above, we can then formulate the design-for-testibility
problem as follows.

\noindent\textit{Given}: A biochip architecture with the application to be
executed.

\noindent\textit{Output}: An augmented biochip architecture for testability; a set of test
vectors considering valve sharing; a schedule of the application on the
augmented biochip architecture.

\noindent\textit{Objectives}: The augmented architecture requires only a
single pressure source and a single pressure meter for testing 
manufacturing defects; the execution efficiency of the application should be
maintained at the same level.
