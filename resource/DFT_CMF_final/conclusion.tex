\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion} 
In this paper, we have proposed a
method to generate a biochip architecture with single-source single-meter
testablity, so that the cost of the test platform can be reduced. The valves
added for DFT share control channels with other existing valves so that no
additional control ports are required. The performance of these chips in
executing applications has also been maintained using  
particle swarm optimization.
