\subsubsection{WP6: Reliability-aware macrosynthesis}

In a biochip, the valves in a mixer for peristalsis switch far more often
than the other valves controlling flow transportation. 
Consequently, these valves wear out quickly, leading to reliability issues 
in executing large-scale biochemical assays. 

This reliability problem can be alleviated by distributing the function of
peristalsis to different valves
%. By rotating the valves 
so that the switching
activities on different valves can be balanced. As shown in
\figname~\ref{fig:archi}(d), the valves inside the dynamic mixers do
not overlap, although they occupy the same area on the FPVA. We will
take advantage of this feature to map dynamic mixers with different
orientations and in different areas to reduce the maximum valve usage. 
This optimization needs to be considered in both hierarchical partition 
and floorplan on the FPVA. 

After finishing this work package, the results of dynamic mapping and
reliability improvement will be published as the third paper from this project.
