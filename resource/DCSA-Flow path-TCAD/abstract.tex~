Flow-based microfluidic biochips have attracted much attention in the EDA
community. %due to its miniaturized size and high execution efficiency. 
Previous research, however, still focuses on 
%assay mapping, washing and test of 
biochips with given architectures, which, unfortunately,
may not be optimal in executing biochemical assays. In this paper, we
propose the first architectural synthesis framework considering distributed storage,
which are constructed temporarily in transportation channels to cache fluid samples.
Since %fluid samples in 
distributed storage can be accessed more efficiently 
than traditional dedicated storage units, biochips synthesized by the proposed 
method achieve a high execution efficiency with fewer resources.
Experimental results confirm that all test cases with very compact schedules 
can be executed successfully 
%within the scheduled time 
and resource usage is also reduced significantly compared 
with conventional design.
