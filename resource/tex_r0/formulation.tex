\section{Fault Model and Problem Formulation}\label{sec:formulation}

During manufacturing of flow-based biochips, various defects may occur. For
example,  the flow channel under a valve may be broken
and does not allow any fluid to pass, leading to a fault equivalent to the
case that the valve cannot be opened. In addition,  leakage may appear between
neighboring flow channels, so that fluids in them may be directed to incorrect
devices or mixed unexpectedly. Furthermore, if the control channel to a valve
becomes broken, air pressure  may not reach the valve. Consequently, this valve
cannot be closed and thus causes a constant leakage.  Furthermore, a leakage may
also appear between two control channels, so that  the valves they drive are
always opened and closed together. 
%another fault scenario leading to malfunction of the chip potentially. 
These cases of manufacturing defects are illustrated 
in \figname~\ref{fig:defects} from \cite{HuYHC14}.


%The defects in a manufactured flow-based biochip have been analyzed in detail
%and the corresponding fault models have been defined in \cite{HuYHC14}.

%Defects in manufactured biochips may cause malfunction in executing bioassays.
According to how the defects affect the behavior of a valve or a channel,
typical faults 
%at component level 
can be defined as follows:

\begin{itemize}

\item \textit{Broken flow channel}: Fluid cannot pass through a channel. This is
equivalent to the fault that the valve at the entrance of the channel cannot be
opened.  

\item \textit{Leaking flow channel}: Fluid in a channel leaks to its
  neighboring channel. In FPVAs, this fault is similar to the case 
  that a valve separating two cells cannot be closed. 

  %If a valve does not exist between the two channels with
  %leakage, such as in traditional biochips,  a virtual valve can be assumed
  %%between them and its state should be always closed. The leakage defect can
  %thus be covered if a test pattern identifies that this virtual valve needs to
  %be opened to realize the observed results. 

\item \textit{Broken control channel}: Valve cannot be closed.

\item \textit{Leaking control channel}: Two valves open or close simultaneously
  due to the shared air pressure in the control channels.

\end{itemize}
Since the faults that valves are stuck at the always-closed or always-open
states are similar to the stuck-at-0 faults and stuck-at-1 faults in digital
circuits, these faults are henceforth called \textit{stuck-at-0 faults}
and \textit{stuck-at-1 faults} for convenience.

With these fault models, test of traditional flow-based biochips has been
examined in \cite{HuYHC14}. The concept of this method can be explained
using the example illustrated in \figname~\ref{fig:classic_test}(a) from
\cite{HuYHC14}. In this test concept, a pressure source is connected to the
input port of the chip to create air pressure along the channels in the flow
layer. Pressure sensors are attached to the output ports of the chip to detect air
pressure. By switching the valves open or closed according to test patterns,
the air pressure read by the pressure sensors 
at the output ports can be used to determine whether
there is a fault in the chip. In this test process, an air pressure is applied
to the flow channels to detect faults, so that the chip is not
contaminated after test. This air pressure for the purpose of test 
is completely unrelated to the pressure applied in the control channels to 
switch valves when the chip executes bioassays.

In \figname~\ref{fig:classic_test}(a), an air pressure can only be detected at
an output port if there is a path from the pressure source to the output port. For example,
if only the valves $a, g, h, i, k$ are open,  a pressure can be detected
at $o_2$. However, during this test if a valve on this path cannot be opened due to
defects, no pressure can be detected at $o_2$, indicating the
existence of a stuck-at-0 fault. On the other hand, if a valve on this path is also
closed intentionally during the test, all paths from the source to the output
ports should be blocked,
so that no air pressure should be detected at any output port. If, on the
contrary, the test results show that a pressure can still be observed by a
sensor, a stuck-at-1 fault should exist in the chip to allow a path from the
source to an output port to be formed. In this test process,   
the states of the valves during a pressure actuation-measurement cycle is
called a \textit{test pattern}. It is the task of test generation to generate
as few test patterns as possible to detect the faults in a chip efficiently.

To generate test patterns, the method in \cite{HuYHC14} converts the
biochip under test into a circuit as shown in
\figname~\ref{fig:classic_test}(b), where the inputs of the circuit
represent valves and the outputs of the circuit represent the output ports
of the chip. In this circuit representation, valves along the same
channel segment are inputs of AND gates, e.g., $b, c, d, e, f$ and $g,
h$. If two channels converge at a point, 
%e.g., the two channels through $f$ and $h$, 
%e.g., the converging point between the valves $f, h, i$, 
an OR gate is created in the circuit representation, since a pressure through
any of these channels can reach the converging point. Consequently, 
the circuit represents the relation between valves and the paths from the source to
the output ports in the chip.
%defines the relation between valves in activating pressure at the output ports. 
%Therefore, 
To generate test patterns for the biochip, it is
equivalent to generate test patterns for the circuit representation, which can
be achieved by a standard ATPG tool as shown in \cite{HuYHC14}.

%In addition to valve faults,  the ATPG-based method can also efficiently deal
%with channel leakage faults. A flow channel leakage fault leads to two channel
%segments being filled with fluid at the same time if one of them is filled. 
%This is equivalent to the case that if a node in the test circuit is `1',
%another node is also `1', an OR-bridge fault in the circuit representation.  If
%there is a leakage in the control channel, two valves close simultaneously if
%one of them is closed. This is an AND-bridge fault in the circuit.  By using
%the equivalent circuit test structure, both bridge faults can be tested with
%ATPG vectors efficiently.

The ATPG-based method has the advantage that the biochip under test needs only
to be converted into a circuit representation. The real test generation is
performed using test generation methods for integrated circuits.
However, it is challenging to apply this method directly to test FPVAs
shown in \figname~\ref{fig:archi}(a).  
In converting a biochip into a circuit representation, the structure of the chip
should be known.
%the relation between valves should be known. This relation is defined by 
%path information from the pressure source to the output ports. 
On an FPVA, the shapes and locations of devices and transportation
channels are dynamically determined according to the operations to be executed.
%there is no such a path structure, because all devices are created dynamically
%according to the operations to be executed. 
If the ATPG-based method is still applied, it then needs to cover 
a huge number of dynamic chip architectures, which is 
a challenging task in view of the flexibility of FPVAs.

In this paper, we propose a new test framework for detecting faults in an FPVA
%a manufactured chip reliably 
with only a small set of test patterns. This problem can be formulated as follows:
\begin{itemize}

  \item{Input:} An FPVA architecture; the locations of long channels (no valve
    built, conceptually always open) and obstacles (conceptually always
    closed); the locations of the air pressure source and the pressure sensors.

\item{Output:} A set of test patterns, each of which defines the
open/closed states of all valves when test pressure is applied
at the source and checked at the output ports by the pressure sensors.

\item{Objective:} The number of test patterns should be 
  as small as possible to reduce test cost; faults should be detected reliably by
  covering all valves.
  %the number of undetected faults should be as small as possible.

\end{itemize}
