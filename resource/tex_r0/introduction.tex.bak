\section{Introduction}

Microfluidic biochips have revolutionized the traditional
slow and error-prone biochemical experiment flow by manipulating fluid
droplets at nanoliter level, using electrowetting in digital biochips or
micropumps in flow-based biochips.  With this miniaturization, bioassays
can be scaled down to nanoliter volumes, and executed by
moving tiny fluid samples between exact locations precisely.
These technologies provide automatic atomic operations for manipulating fluid
samples such as split, move, mix, and detect, with which a traditional
bioassay can be constructed and executed efficiently
\cite{JMSQ07,JEMP08,KrCh10}.
%
On a microfluidic biochip, genomic bioassay protocols, such as nucleic-acid
isolation, DNA purification, and DNA sequencing have been successfully
demonstrated.  In addition, these technologies have also attracted a lot of
commercial attention such as from Illumina \cite{illumina}, a market leader in DNA
sequencing.

Microfluidic biochip technologies have many advantages due to the
miniaturization of reaction samples.  Since all the atomic operations are
performed at the nanoliter level, only very small volumes of test samples 
are required. In other words, the normal volumes of test samples 
can now support a large number of reactions, e.g., for disease diagnosis.
In addition, nanoliter sample droplets on a biochip can be moved very quickly,
and the reaction between two droplets takes significantly less time to finish
due to the reduced reaction volumes. Furthermore, this miniaturization enables
the long-aspired large system integration, where many
applications can be executed in parallel. 

The state-of-the-art microfluidic technologies can be catergorized into two
groups.
In the first group, fluid droplets are located on a patterned array of electrodes and
moved by the force of electrowetting. 
This technique has the advantage of dynamic reconfiguration
but it is limited when dealing
with some applications due to the applied high voltage.  The second group of
microfluidic biochips, which we will focus on in this paper, uses microvalves
to control the movement of reaction samples.  The structure of a microvalve
is shown in \figname~\ref{fig:valve_mixer_storage}a.  In such a structure, a
flow channel is constructed on a substrate for transportation of fluid
samples.  Above the flow channel, a control channel is constructed and
connected to an air pressure source. Since both channels are built from
elastic materials, air pressure applied in the control channel squeezes the
flow channel tightly, so that the movement of the fluid sample is blocked.
Reversely, if the pressure in the control channel is released, the fluid
sample can resume its movement to the target device. Consequently, a valve is
formed at the crossing point of the two channels to control the flow
direction. Compared with electrowetting-driven biochips, valve-based biochips
can execute nearly all experiments so that they have
become the focus of the research community in recent years.

Valves can also be used to build complex devices. For example, the
structure of a mixer is shown in \figname~\ref{fig:valve_mixer_storage}b.  If
the three valves at the top of the mixer are actuated alternately by applying
and releasing air pressure in the control channels with a given pattern, a
circular flow around the device can be formed to mix different fluid samples.
After an operation is finished, the intermediate result can be transported to
other devices or saved temporarily in a dedicated storage unit.
\figname~\ref{fig:valve_mixer_storage}c shows a detailed schematic of a mixer
connected to a storage unit with eight cells. These side-by-side storage cells
are constructed from normal flow channels but with multiplexer-like
controlling valves at each end. 
%Consequently, only one fluid sample can enter or leave the 
%storage unit at a given moment.

The chip structure demonstrated in \figname~\ref{fig:valve_mixer_storage}c was
designed by researchers 
%in the microfluidic field with 
using preliminary tools such as AutoCAD to draw the channels at different
layers manually. After the schematic is finished, a chip is manufactured by
etching the substrate on which fluid and control channels are formed. This
design flow, however, only works with chips of a small scale, 
containing only a few channels and devices. 
%To take advantage of 
With the advances of manufacturing technologies, where many thousands
valves can be integrated into a chip as small as a coin, the locations of
devices and their channel connections can only be determined by computer
algorithms for an efficient design.  Another limitation of the traditional
biochip structure in \figname~\ref{fig:valve_mixer_storage}c comes from the
irregularities of devices. Similar to the case in the semiconductor industry,
a large-scale integration chip benefits from a regular structure, at least at
physical level. But the round mixers 
%and the irregular transportation channels 
in the traditional
structure hinder the further improvement of integration for large-scale
biochemical analyses.

Noticing the requirements of further system integration, researchers 
%in the microfluidic society 
have been exploring different chip architectures. 
For example, fully programmable valve arrays (FPVAs)
%The concept of a regular structure has been

%attempted in the early work
%Quake et. al 
\cite{JMSQ07,matrix11}.
%and the first prototype toward large-scale integration has
%been demonstrated in the work Maerkl et. al 
\figname~\ref{fig:archi}a shows a part of the large valve array demonstrated
in \cite{matrix11} and a drawing of partial enlargement of four valves
controlling the four directions of the fluid sample in an enclosed cell at a
crossing point is shown in \figname~\ref{fig:archi}b.  In this architecture,
valves (solid blocks) are arranged regularly along horizontal and vertical
flow channels (light color). These valves are controlled by air pressure
sources through the control channels (narrow channels). By opening two valves
and closing the other two, the fluid sample at the crossing point can be moved to
the intended direction for transportation. Consequently, flexible flow
paths can be formed by opening and closing a set of valves, as shown in
\figname~\ref{fig:archi}c. 

Besides flow paths, complex devices such as mixers can also be constructed on 
the valve array taking advantage of the
flexibility and reconfigurability of such chips.
For example, a 4$\times$2 and a 2$\times$4 mixer can be constructed as in 
\figname~\ref{fig:dynamic_devices}a and \figname~\ref{fig:dynamic_devices}b,
respectively. In such a dynamic mixer, the eight valves along the enclosed channel 
function as pump valves which switch in a given pattern 
to drive the fluid samples inside the channel for mixing. Compared with the
traditional mixer shown in \figname~\ref{fig:valve_mixer_storage}b, these dynamic
mixers have a different shape and more pump valves, eight in each case, to
form a strong circular flow to mix different samples.
The two mixers in 
\figname~\ref{fig:dynamic_devices}a and \ref{fig:dynamic_devices}b,
can share the same part of the chip area as
shown in \figname~\ref{fig:dynamic_devices}c,
provided that the two mixers are not
used at the same time. 
On valve arrays, further special devices such as heaters and detectors can 
also be built at certain locations. In addition, fluid samples 
can be transported between devices by forming a temporary flow path
between two devices. After the transportation is finished, the flow path can
be released and the valves can be reused for other functions.

The valve array architecture has a tremendous advantage in large-scale
integration, because a regular structure is easy to design 
and manufacture compared with the traditional nonregular architecture.
%simplifies the optimization of the manufacturing process. 
A counterpart of this regular structure is the DRAM %(random-access memory) 
array in the semiconductor industry, where the manufacturing technology 
of DRAM chips is normally a generation more advanced than that of other chips,
e.g.,
microprocessors. In addition, the ability of dynamic reconfigurability gives
the valve array the advantage to execute nearly any application. 
%This a characteristic very similar to the one of FPGA (field programmable gate array) 
%in semiconductor industry, and it 
This allows chip vendors to focus on improving the integration 
scale without worrying about the applications. On the other hand, customers
using such chips also have the flexibility to perform various or even
unforeseen applications, a great advantage specially for 
small
%tributary local
hospitals or research units which usually cannot afford many expensive apparatus.

To use the valve arrays for biochemical experiments and
diagnoses, two problems need to be solved first. 
At the application level, biochemical operations should be mapped to 
the valve array by forming dynamic devices. In addition, transportation channels 
connecting dynamic
devices and storage units should be created.  This problem has been
solved with the method proposed in \cite{TsengLHS15}. 
At the manufacturing level, defects in valve arrays are
inevitable, so that it is necessary to develop efficient fault test
algorithms for such a valve array. After faults are detected, some
faults may be isolated while the rest of the chip can still execute
biochemical applications, although the execution performance might be lower,
similar to the concept of chip binning in the semiconductor industry. If 
the number of faults is too large, these chips are discarded and 
counted as yield loss.

As discussed above, FPVAs have a 
great potential to advance the technology of  
flow-based microfluidic biochips for executing
biochemical assays or experiments. However,
the required fault test algorithms are still missing so far, although
there are several methods for testing digital biochips \cite{ZhaoXC08,DinhYHC15}
and traditional flow-based biochips \cite{HuYHC14,HuHC14,PopAC15}.

In this paper, we propose the first fault test strategy 
for fully programmable valve arrays. Our contributions are as follows:
\begin{easylist}
& We propose the first systematic formulation and test strategy for FPVAs to enable
efficient fault test after manufacturing.
& By constructing flow paths and cut-sets on the chip, only a small number of
test vectors need to be applied to capture faults.
& Faults due to pressure leakage at the control layer of FPVAs 
are also captured.
& The proposed method can guarantee the detection of up to two faults in the
chip, while multiple faults can also be captured in nearly all practical cases.
& The proposed test flow is completely compatible with existing test flowss
for traditional flow-based biochips, so that no special cost is required  
for fault test of FPVAs.
\end{easylist}

The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In
Section~\ref{sec:formulation} we review the existing work on fault test for 
traditional flow-based biochips and formulate the fault test problem for FPVAs.
In Section~\ref{sec:test_method} we present the general test strategy of the
proposed method and explain how this strategy is implemented in detail.
Experimental results are shown in Section~\ref{sec:results}.
The conclusion is given in Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.
