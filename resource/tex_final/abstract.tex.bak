Flow-based microfluidic biochips have become a promising platform for complex
biochemical assays. As the integration of such chips is increasing,  a flexible
general reconfigurable platform, Fully Programmable Valve Array (FPVA), has
emerged.  Such an array is composed of regularly arranged valves, with which
devices of different shapes and sizes as well as transportation paths can be
constructed dynamically.  Due to this reconfigurablilty, test generation for
such chips becomes challenging due to the large number of potential
configuration schemes of devices and transportation  paths.  In this paper, we
propose a strategy to generate efficient test patterns for FPVAs based on the
concepts of test paths and cuts. These patterns together can cover multiple
faults in both flow and control layers. Furthermore, FPVAs with multiple ports
are dealt with by constructing test trees and multiple cuts in one test pattern. 
Moreover, the proposed method can be applied to generate test patterns for
traditional flow-based biochips with predefined architectures.  Simulation results
demonstrate that  manufacturing defects in FPVAs can be detected reliably by a
limited number of  test patterns generated by the proposed method. For 
traditional biochps with predefined architectures,  these patterns also exhibit an
improved test efficiency.
